============================


QUICK START
-----------
The default rendering version on this package is HDRP. If you want to upgrade for either Standard or URP rendering pipeline, you may do so by importing the provided unity packages inside the folder "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\CardGameVFX\Rendering Pipelines"

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO VERIFY YOUR RENDERING PIPELINE IN CASE EVERYTHING LOOKS PINK!

Once you have the right rendering pipeline selected, you can simply choose a particle system inside of the "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\CardGameVFX" folder and drag it into the scene.
