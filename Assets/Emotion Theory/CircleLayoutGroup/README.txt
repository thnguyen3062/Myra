CIRCLE LAYOUT GROUP
A Unity Plugin by Emotion Theory

A UI Component that automatically positions your objects in beautiful circular arrangements.

HOW TO USE

* Add a CircleLayoutGroup component to a UI object. That's it!

* Alternatively, check out some of the samples in the Scenes folder.

FEATURES

* Full Source Code.

* Automatic, simple, intuitive. Add the component to a parent object and have its children arrange themselves accordingly.

* Works just like Unity's built in UI Layout components, i.e. GridLayoutGroup / HorizontalLayoutGroup / VerticalLayoutGroup.

* Several optional parameters can be adjusted to suit your needs, such as dynamic sizing of objects, among several others.
